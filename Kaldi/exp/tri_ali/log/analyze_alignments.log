The optional-silence phone sil occupies 28.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 71.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 6.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.7 hours of data, or 1.2 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 2.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (20,25.1,57)
