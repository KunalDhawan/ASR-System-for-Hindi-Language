 HCompV computes global mean and covariance of a set of training data.
 It is used to initialise parameters of HMM such that all component
 means and covariances are set equal to the global data mean and covariance.\n
Calculating Fixed Variance
  HMM Prototype: htk_files/proto
  Segment Label: None
  Num Streams  : 1
  UpdatingMeans: Yes
  Target Direct: hmm/hmm0
635180 speech frames accumulated
Updating HMM Means and Covariances
Output written to directory hmm/hmm0
Var floor macros output to file hmm/hmm0/vFloors
